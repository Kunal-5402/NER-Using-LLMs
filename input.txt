Example of NER: 

Input text: “conditions can result in the bottoming out the suspension and amplification of the stress 
placed on the floor truss network. the additional stress can result in the fracture of welds securing the floor truss network system to the chassis frame rail and/or fracture of the floor truss network support system. the possibility exists that there could be damage to electrical wiring and/or fuel lines which could potentially lead to a fire.” 

Expected Output:  
{"Entity": "bottoming out the suspension", "Label": "Failure Issue"}, 
{"Entity": "amplification of the stress", "Label": "Failure Issue"},
{"Entity": "floor truss network", "Label": "Component"}, 
{"Entity": "fracture of welds", "Label": "Failure Issue"},  
{"Entity": "chassis frame rail", "Label": "Component"},  
{"Entity": "floor truss network support system", "Label": "Component"}, 
{"Entity": "damage to electrical wiring", "Label": "Failure Issue"}, 
{"Entity": "fuel lines", "Label": "Component"}, 
{"Entity": "fire", "Label": "Failure Issue"}
